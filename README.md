# Mediated Narrative Spring 2016
An interactive narrative experience built on Flask.

This project was created for the Carnegie Mellon University course Mediated Narrative in Spring 2016. It is an interactive experience based around the 1998 film Run Lola Run, directed by Tom Tykwer. As most interactive media often achieves interactivity in a superficial way that is secondary to, and often detracts from the story, our goal was create an open work that centered around a user’s interaction with a character. As they are gaining in popularity, a chatbot, acting as Manni, is the core around which you interpret the narrative. Based on your responses to the film as Lola, the narrative unfolds by displaying short clips from the film. We hope that by putting you in the shoes of the protagonist and having you interact with your ‘costar,’ you will become engaged with the material and be interested in watching the entirety of the film.

## Areas for Improvement
* Use more intelligent natural language processing with chatbot (need training data)
* Implement alternative web player that can handle the bandwidth
